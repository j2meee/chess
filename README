texture.h and texture.cpp acquired from http://www.spacesimulator.net/tut3_texturemapping.html/ Written originally by Damiano Vitulli and ported for MAC OSX by Karakoussis Apostolos, it is essentially a binary .bmp image reader with simple texture commands to add the .bmp files to OpenGL.

The board pieces are each textured with a marble color for the black and white pieces (marbblack.bmp and marbwhite.bmp). They are rotated randomly at system initialization to provide a more natural look to the board.

Pieces are moved by clicking on a piece during translate mode and clicking on an unoccupied board square. When a piece is moving, the board can be rotated but transforming the viewpoint or selecting other pieces have been disabled.

Quick key reference chart below.

Description of game functionality:

Camera:
Rotation is controlled with the right mouse button by clicking and dragging.
Zoom is controlled by < and >.
Look position is controlled by left mouse button when an item is picked but chess piece placement
modes are not active, by clicking and dragging.

Lights:
Lights are controlled in pre-set positions around the game board using the 0-7 keys.
The light colors can be adjusted by the user by selecting a particular light and pressing
the a,s, and d keys in order to change ambient, spectral, and diffuse values for those particular
lights. The values are controlled for R, G, and B by using the keys u, i, and o on the keyboard.
Lower case u-o increases the color value for the respective color, upper case decreases it.

Piece placement:
Chess pieces are selected with the z through b keys along the bottom row of the keyboard. As shown
in the user interface, capital letters in that range add green chess pieces while lower case letters
add the red chess pieces. The spacebar can also be used to seed the entire board with a properly
positioned board for easy observation, as well as remove the seeding. Be careful about seeding the board
when you have already placed pieces in the start area - they will be overdrawn.
